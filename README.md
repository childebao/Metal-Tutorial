# Metal Tutorials
This repository contains a [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) implementation of the [Lightweight Java Game Library](https://www.lwjgl.org/) (LWJGL) [OpenGL tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP) by [Thin Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/).  I'd been trying to learn 3D graphics programming for a while when I came across these tutorials.  I found the explanations very clear and understandable, but unfortunately I had no interest in learning Java and the LWJGL, I wanted to learn Swift and Metal.  As a learning exercise I decided to implement the tutorials using Swift, Metal, [MetalKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalkit), and [ModelIO](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio) - the first party frameworks provided by Apple for iOS, macOS, and tvOS.

Thin Matrix makes his living as an Indie Game Developer, so if you find these tutorials useful you should send him some money using [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thinmatrix) or buy his game [Equilinox](https://equilinox.com/).  You can also follow Thin Matrix on Twitter [@ThinMatrix](https://twitter.com/thinmatrix).

## Resources
I've created a seperate [document](https://github.com/keithsharp/Metal-Tutorial/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) with links to various Metal resources.

## Using the Repository
Check the repsitory out using:
```bash
git clone https://ithub.com:keithsharp/Metal-Tutorial.git
```
The code at the end of each tutorial can then be identifed by a tag, for example `tut001` is the tag for the complete code after [tutorial one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E).
